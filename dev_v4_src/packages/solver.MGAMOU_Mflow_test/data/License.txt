   Mflow_02 is a solver to calculate two-dimensional plane unsteady flow and riverbed variation using unstructured meshes of the finite element method. The original version of Mflow_02 was based on program developed in late 1980s by G. Tomitokoro of Shinshu University (Tomidokoro et al, 1985). Thereafter, M. Gamou (former staff of Pacific Consultants Co. Ltd, currently Gamou Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd.), K. Hamaguchi and M. Ichiyama (Pacific Consultants Co. Ltd) led the core work to expand and develop the model.
  By applying the characteristic of unstructured meshes, this model can calculate unsteady flow in a region including structures like piers, weirs, etc., or to calculate flooding of a complex area, like a floodplain area connected to a river channel network with many distributaries and confluences (Figure 11). In addition, the solver allows calculation of riverbed variation and the appearance, development and movement of sandbars. There are a number of practical applications, like the application for impact assessment of piers, etc., impact assessment of vegetation and trees, flooding calculation and estuary sandbar flush (Figure 12).
