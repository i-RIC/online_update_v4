# What is GELATO
GELATO(GEneralized LAgrangian Tracking with Optimization)(former UTT(Universal Tracer Tracker)) is a new Lagrangian particle-tracking code that incorporates both advection and dispersion by turbulence (or other unresolved details of the flow field). 
Unlike previous models, GELATO is flow solver independent, works for one, two, and three-dimensional applications, and has a unique particle cloning/colligation technique that allows high spatial resolution without high computational expense. Importantly, the method is suitable for applications on typical laptop or desktop computers in the iRIC framework for flow, sediment transport, morphodynamics and habitat modelling in rivers (freely available at www.i- ric.org).

# Release notes
ver.1.3.25020501 update by hoshino
* Fixed a bug where particles were removed at the upstream and downstream ends even when periodic boundary conditions were enabled.
* Added a function to output the calculation time. The time taken for the calculation is displayed at the end of the console.

ver.1.3.24070801 update by hoshino
* Fix solver display name.

ver.1.3.24062401 update by hoshino
* Modified the particle output processing in accordance with the update to iRIC.

ver.1.3.24041501 update by shimizu and hoshino
* Added a function to stop the tracer depending on the calculated maximum friction velocity.
* Modified the coordinate transformation formula for the tracer.
* Changed the layout of the calculation conditions dialog.

ver.1.2.23122001 update by hoshino
* Fixed translation file.

ver.1.2.23050901 update by hoshino
* Fixed to be able to open UTT project.

ver.1.2.23050801 update by shimizu and jon
* Changed solver name from UTT to GELATO

ver.1.2.23021301 update by hoshino
* Add case study link to README.

ver.1.2.23020301 update by hoshino
* Fixed a bug that caused a crash when outputting calculation results with no tracers within the calculation range.
* Revised GUI parameter names, etc. (The parameters used have not been changed.)
* Change console message

ver.1.2.23020101 update by hoshino
* Fixed a bug that flow velocity etc. are not output unless fish simulation is performed.
* Fixed a bug that the tracer in the calculation range is not excluded even if it flows out of the range when it is the last one in "primary" and "secondary" respectively.
* Changed "Primary" and "Secondary" tracers, which were treated as one group, to be treated as independent groups.

ver.1.2.23013001 update by shimizu
* Added a function to divide normal tracers into two types, "primary" and "secondary".
* Until now, tracers were removed in areas below the Minimum depth of tracer stopping, but now you can choose to remain in place and resume movement when the water depth exceeds the Minimum depth of tracer stopping.
* GUI changes due to the above.

ver.1.2.23011901 update by hoshino
* Fixed the rendering method of trees and gravel polygons.
* Fixed a bug that the special tracer's coordinates became incorrect when the number of times the special tracer's trajectory was saved exceeded the "maximum number of time steps when saving the trajectory".

ver.1.2.22111001 update by shimizu
* Added a function to draw polygons of trees and gravel.
