# What is GELATO
GELATO(GEneralized LAgrangian Tracking with Optimization)(former UTT(Universal Tracer Tracker)) is a new Lagrangian Tracer-tracking code that incorporates both advection and dispersion by turbulence (or other unresolved details of the flow field). 
Unlike previous models, GELATO is flow solver independent, works for one, two, and three-dimensional applications, and has a unique Tracer cloning/colligation technique that allows high spatial resolution without high computational expense. Importantly, the method is suitable for applications on typical laptop or desktop computers in the iRIC framework for flow, sediment transport, morphodynamics and habitat modelling in rivers (freely available at www.i- ric.org).
