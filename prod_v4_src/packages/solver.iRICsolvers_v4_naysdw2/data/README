# What is NaysDw2
naysDw2 is a 2D driftwood tracking tool that reads flow calculation results from iRIC solvers such as Nays2DH and adds and tracks driftwood at arbitrary time intervals.
2D driftwood is transported and tracked by applying the material transportation function of GELATO (formerly UTT). The principle is the same as GELATO (formerly UTT) in that driftwood is tracked in a Lagrangian manner, but the force applied to the driftwood itself is also taken into account. It also has the features of the discrete element method.
The sight of the driftwood rotating and drifting away is very soothing.
